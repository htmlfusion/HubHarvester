HubHarvester Tracking
=====================

![master build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/omigos/HubHarvester.svg)

This was a fork of the project klokantech/github-time-tracking , but since i wanted to support
everything around github (so 3rd party apps like huboard too), i created this extension.  

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hubharvester-time-trackin/nfjjpilhlncfoehpfhomhhadieegecgn

## Description

This extension adds a time tracking button to different issue tracker tools. Currently supported:

- GitHub.com
- HuBoard.com
- GitLab (only tested in v6.1)

If you need anything else supported, head over to https://github.com/omigos/HubHarvester and open a new issue. Even better, if you are able to code some javascript, see the documentation and create your own provider. Don't forget the pull request :). 

See extension options for configuring urls and note templates.
